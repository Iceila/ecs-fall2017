    <p><b>WHAT IS ANATOMY?</b></p>

    <p>Anatomy seems the most unnecessary of the five fundamentals on this site. After all, we’re not all drawing humans, are we? But most of the art jobs currently, animators, video game designers, and concept artists all need to know anatomy for their job. If you draw anything living, or create a creature, you need a basis of anatomy to make those characters realistic and solid.</p>
    <p>Anatomy is probably the most complicated on this list to learn, so I won’t go too in depth here. Anatomy is essentially the study of the human body—this can be the bones, muscles, or organs. Anatomy doesn't always apply to art.</p>
    <p>The study of anatomy in terms of art includes the muscles and the bone. We study the bones because they remain pretty much the same in a skinny person or a muscular person. But muscles do. Knowing the muscles can help you make a solid figure; knowing the bones can help you create from your imagination.</p>
    <p>Remember, everything can be simlified down to the basic forms.</p><br>
    
    <p><b>HOW TO LEARN ANATOMY</b></p>
    <p>With anatomy, there's no need to learn every single bone or muscle. In art, we're focused only on the most major of muscle masses and most major of bones.</p>
    <p>Start your studies on the bones. Figure out the types of joints, how they move, and their structure. Then move on to the major muscle masses, and learn how they are shaped around each bone.</p>
    <p>Learning anatomy is the most rigorous on this list. But take your time, and your animals and humans will be drawn much more realistically. Learning anatomy will give you the ability to create live beings.</p>

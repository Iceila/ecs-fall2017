          <p>Art is beneficial to your health. Like a diary, you can find ways to express yourself and boost your creativity.</p>
          <p>Most people think that learning art is hard. But in fact, it is a very methodical and systematic process. It can be something you do for just a couple minutes a day, or spend hours laboring on.</p>
          <p>Whatever the reason, art can even boost your performance in your job. Art is abstract, and can be applied to so many situations.</p>
          <p>Finally, art will give you skills such as creativity, perseverance, and so much more.</p>

    <p><b>WHAT IS STRUCTURE?</b></p>
    <img class="imagewrap-right" src="https://iceila.github.io/images/1e6e8e782fe2dbf0d42d63ad3a094d3c.jpg" alt="Cube, Cylinder, Sphere" width="410px" height="230px" style="padding-left:50px">
   <p>This fundamental goes by many different names. Structure, form, construction, are all names of this fundamental. But what you learn never changes. Structure is used in every piece of art you create. That's why it's the first one you should learn. Put simply, structure is the ability to make something on paper appear three-dimensional.</p>
   <p>This effect is achieved through the study of the basic shapes: cube, cylinder, and sphere. Although there are other simple shapes, these are the ones covered on this website. Understanding these shapes allow you to understand the different planes of a figure, the how to shade a figure, and the form of that figure.</p>
   <p>Most artists skip the structure fundamentals and try to learn art by copying photos. This results in flat drawings, as they are only measuring the distance between objects. They do not understand the forms underneath the skin.</p><br>
   
   <p><b>LEARNING STRUCTURE</b></p>
   <p>Understand the basic shapes first. Practice drawing them. Make sure your lines are steady, clear, and bold. If you can, observe these shapes around you. Your tablet is a flat rectangular prism. Your arm is two cylinders connected by a sphere.</p>
   <p>Start by drawing them without shading. Do your shapes look realistic without shadow? Do they look 3-D? If you compare your drawings to photos, are your circles circular? The aim of this exercise is to get you acquainted with the three main shapes and build your arm and wrist strength. Remember, <i>sketching is made up of straight and curved lines</i>.</p>
   <p>If you feel that you can draw these shapes sufficiently, move on to adding the shadows and shading. Observe shadows in real life. What does the shadow look like when the object is closer to the ground? Farther? Make sure you can make a sufficient shadow without the help of blending tools. This can be a gradient, crosshatching, or a mixture of both.</p><br>
   
   <p><b>APPLYING STRUCTURE TO YOUR ART</b></p>
   <img class="imagewrap-left" src="https://iceila.github.io/images/cube_large.jpg" alt="Cube sketch" width="410px" height="270px" style="padding-right:50px; padding-bottom:20px">
   <p>You’ve learned the three basic forms. You can sketch them, render them, and understand them. Now what? You don’t see a cylinder in a face...right?</p>
   <p>Structure is at the basis of everything—buildlings, objects, and even humans. Everything can be simplified into those three forms. A simple rectangle can start to become a face. These shapes are not static in their positions. You can bend cylinders, shave off a corner of a cube, and shorten and lengthen them.</p>
   <p>Understanding three forms can go a long way. Before you start adding the details, you must start with the forms. You must start with simplifying the complicated chunks of that photo you're copying, or from your imagination, into those three forms. Then once everything is in place, you can add the details.</p><br>
   
   <p class="challenge">Challenge: Deconstruct a complicated shape, such as the human body, into the three shapes. Feel free to modify the shapes a bit to fit your needs. Remember that someone looking at your art should be able to tell that your art was made up of the three shapes.</p>

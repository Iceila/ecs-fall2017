    <p>A more formal name for this fundamental is color theory. But since this combines the fundamentals of value and colors together, I've just given it the vague name of color. Color theory is the study of what colors go together and what doesn't. Value, on the other hand, is the study of the darks and lights on forms.</p>
    <p>This website makes use of color theory. Blue and yellow are opposites, which clash together great when used in design.</p>
    <p>Value mainly applies to people that are seeking to draw objects that look three-dimensional. For example, if you were shading a sphere, depending on where the light is aimed, and how close that light is, you'll get darker and sharper shadows than if the light is far away.</p>
    <p>If you combine both colors and value together, you get darker colors, lighter colors, and all the blacks, greys, and whites.</p><br><br><br><br>

    <p><b>HOW TO LEARN COLORS</b></p>
    <p>Value should be mastered before color theory. Learn to identify the measure of darkness or brightness in an art piece. Darks and lights determine what part of your piece your viewers focus on. Darker is less noticeable. Lighter stands out. Once you have the dark and light down, the colors add more. Know how dark shadows are in certain situations, as well as the highlights.</p>
    <p>There’s not much to learning color theory. Once you master the fundamentals of drawing, your drawings will look great on their own because of their structure. Colors add that little extra punch.</p>
    <p>Learn the primary, secondary, and tertiary colors. Use colors that compliment each other, such as opposite colors or color triads. There are endless combinations you can make with color.</p>
   
   <p class="challenge">Challenge: Use two colors that generally don’t compliment each other, and try to make an aesthetically pleasing piece with that palette.</p>

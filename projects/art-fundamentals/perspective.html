    <p><b>WHAT IS PERSPECTIVE?</b></p>

    <p>You know the basic forms now. But they look a little...flat. You can probably only draw them facing you. Perspective is takes what you've learned about structure one step further, adding that little touch to make things more 3D. Perspective will give you the skills to make something appear above you, below you, farther, and closer.</p>
    <p>In a formal definition, perspective is the practice of making something appear three-dimensional on a two-dimensional surface. Look to the image on the left. These are the three main types of perspective. The points, also called vanishing points, are the point where your subject becomes so small it becomes a dot on the horizon. Hence the name vanishing points.</p><br>
    <p>The horizon line is the place where all the vanishing points line up. It is the perfect middle. If you put your shape above the horizon line, you will only see the bottom. Below, and you will see the top of your shape.</p>
    <p>One-point-perspective is used when you want to look at only one side, like someone facing a wall. Two-point is used when you want to show part of each side, like a three-quarters view of a cube. Three-point-perspective is used only for extreme views, such as bird’s eye view or worm’s eye view. This is achieved by adding a third point of perspective above or below the horizon line.</p><br>

    <p><b>HOW TO LEARN PERSPECTIVE</b></p>
    <p>Learning perspective begins easy. However, once you start to render more complicated shapes, it becomes a more difficult to master. Start basic. Study with the cube. Try using all three perspective types on it. When you’re done, try the cylinder. Once you feel proficient in both, move on to the sphere. To make something realistic takes a long time. So take your time. Learning perspective is a long and tedious process, but by the end, you’ll be able to draw landscapes, cityscapes, and so much more. </p>

  <h1>Quotations</h1>
  <p>So what if you're writing an essay on a web page? You need to quote, right? HTML offers two ways to format quotations on a webpage. One automatically adds quotations around your text. The other indents your text a bit more than the original paragraph.</p><br>
  <p>This is a quote from Wikipedia:
    <q>Chichester was granted in 1727 to Nathaniel Gookin and others</q>
  </p><br>

  <p>This is a block quote from Wikipedia:</p>
  <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defoliant">A defoliant is any chemical sprayed or dusted on plants to cause its leaves to fall off. Defoliants differ from herbicides in that the former seeks mainly to strip leaves from plants, and the latter is used to destroy or inhibit the growth of certain plants. Defoliants are used in cotton production to aid harvesting.</blockquote><br>

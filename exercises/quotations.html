  <p>This is a block quote from Wikipedia:</p>
  <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defoliant">A defoliant is any chemical sprayed or dusted on plants to cause its leaves to fall off. Defoliants differ from herbicides in that the former seeks mainly to strip leaves from plants, and the latter is used to destroy or inhibit the growth of certain
    plants. Defoliants are used in cotton production to aid harvesting.</blockquote>

  <p>Addresses are different for certain types of links. If you have a link to a local file, such as your homepage, you don't have to type out the whole URL. If you want links to an external URL, then you have to add the entire URL, https included.</p>
  
  <a href="/index.html">This is a link to a local file.</a>
  <a href="https://w3schools.com">This is a link to an external file.</a>
 
  <p>Links can also be added to images, like the home button on the pagebar.</p>

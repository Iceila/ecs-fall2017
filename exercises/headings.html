  <h1>Headings</h1>

  <p>Headings are your titles in HTML. Imagine that you didn't have the &lt;h1> tag. You'd have to increase the size of the text, bold the text, and do a bunch of extra things. That's why headings are so great in web development. It reduces the amount of time that you have to code a single website. There are 6 different headings, so you can break something in a website down six times. If you want more, you'll have to make them yourself.

  <h2>This is a heading.</h2>
  <h3>This is a heading.</h3>
  <h4>This is a heading.</h4>
  <h5>This is a heading.</h5>
  <h6>This is a heading.</h6>

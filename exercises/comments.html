  <h1>Comments</h1>
  <p>In HTML, you can add comments in your code. The browser ignores the lines of code and displays them in the source code. If you want to see some comments, you have to view the source code of this website.</p>

  <!--This is a comment! The computer ignores this line of code. It's here for your own personal pleasure. -->

  <!--[if IE9]>
<p>So you're on Internet Explorer 9, are you?</p>

  <!-- The comment above only applies to people on Internet Explorer. It's a weird addition, but it's there.-->

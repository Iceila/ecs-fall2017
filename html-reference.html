  <h1 style="margin-top:80px;">HTML Reference</h1>
  <p>This entire website is coded in HTML. But if you don't know HTML, you can't figure out how this website is made. For my own reference and yours, these are the basics of HTML.</p><br>

  <h3>Boilerplate Code</h3>
  <p>The code below is the standard code needed to make anything related to HTML. It should be the first thing you type or paste into your HTML file.</p>
  <pre>
  <code>
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html>
    &lt;html>

    &lt;head>
      &lt;title>This is a Title&lt;/title>
    &lt;/head>

    &lt;body>

      &lt;/h1>This is a heading&lt;/h1>
      &lt;p>This is a paragraph.&lt;/p>

    &lt;/body>

    &lt;/html>
  </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html></code> tells your HTML file that you'll be using HTML on this document.<br><br>
    <code>&lt;html></code> is the place you'll put all your HTML code in.<br><br>
    <code>&lt;head></code> is where all the elements that don't show up direcly on the page go.<br><br>
    <code>&lt;title></code> is one example of such an element. This page's title is HTML Reference.<br><br>
    <code>&lt;body></code> is where you find all the code that makes up the actual webpage.<br><br>
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h3>&lt;body> Commands</h3>
  <p>All these commands allow you to add information to your site.</p>

  <h5>Headings &lt;h1></h5>
  <p>The <code>&lt;h1></code> automatically format your text on your web page to be more noticable than a paragraph, by increasing the font size and bolding it. The text on the top of the page is an example of &lt;h1>. There are six heading styles, each one progressively smaller than the last heading.</p><br>
  <code>&lt;h1>This is a heading&lt;/h1></code>

  <h5>Paragraphs &lt;p></h5>
  <p>This is a paragraph. Everything that's got normal text is a normal paragraph. Paragraphs have no font style, unless you <b>bold</b> the text on your own. Other ways you can style a paragraph is by <i>italicizing</i> or <u>underlining</u>.</p><br>
  <code>&lt;p>This is a paragraph!&lt;/p></code>
  
  <p><code>&lt;br></code> is another way to edit paragraph styles. It indents a line from the previous block of information.<br>This line is indented with the <code>&lt;br></code> command.</p><br><br>
  
  <p>The <code>&lt;hr></code> command inserts a horizontal line across the page. You can use this to separate blocks of information. The line looks like so:<br><p>
  <hr>

  <h5>Comments &lt;!-- --></h5>
  <p>When you're coding, you'll often find you need to remind yourself of something, whether it's to fix a certain issue or to give a coworker clarificaiton. Comments are lines of code that the rendering software ignores, and is only visible in your source code. HTML codes are specified as so:<br><br><code>&lt;!-- This is a comment! --></code></p>
  
  <h5>Links &lt;a></h5>
  <p>This tag is also known as the anchor element. Adding the <code>href</code> attribute makes it linkable. You can link text, images, or just about anything you want in HTML. This is the syntax of the anchor tag:<br>
    <code>&lt;a href="#link">This is a link&lt;/a></code><br>You put the URL or local link in between the quotations. </p>
